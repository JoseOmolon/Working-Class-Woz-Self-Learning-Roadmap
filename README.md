# Working-Class-Woz-Self-Learning-Roadmap
This roadmap is designed for someone who wants to self-learn electronics, programming, and embedded systems. This path is tailored to those who are
starting from scratch or with minimal experience, offering a practical approach to gaining skills and
eventually building a career in embedded systems or electronics. It outlines how to go from self-taught basics to hands-on. I can, I will, I must, Or die trying. 12345


# Step 1: Foundations (Months 1-3)

- Learn basic eletronics concepts: voltage, current, amps, resistance, ohm's law, etc.

- Get hands-on with simple kits or breadboards.

- Familiarize yourself with simple microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi
 
# Step 2: Intermediate Skills (Months 4-6)

- Dive deeper into C programming and start learning how to write code for embedded systems.

- Begin learning how to interface with sensors, motors, and other devices.

- Explore IoT concepts and learn to connect devices (smart lights, temperature sensors, etc.)

# Step 3: Advanced Skills and Professionalism (Months 7-12)

- Learn advanced embedded systems topics: RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems), debugging, and optimization.

- Work with advanced microcontrollers like STM32 or ESP32.

- Build more complex IoT projects, like smart home systems, wearable devices, etc.

- Look for entry-level internships or apprenticeships in the embedded systems field.

# Conclusion

The key to becoming a "working class Woz" is consistent learning and hands-on practice. It won't be
easy, and there will be setbacks, but with determination, you can make steady progress.
